            <p>Before to start any business we must know that what is the meaning of Business. Business is not just selling or Buy any product or Services or not just exchange anything. Business is quite more and large topic to not only discuss even understand. To start a new business is not just simple to just buy any product from somewhere or manufacture any product and just sell. These consist of a long process for it. Well, very first thing comes is just to understand the term Business and it’s the necessity.</p>
            <p>“Business is work relating to the production, buying, and selling of goods or services, not for once even on regular basis, for consideration in terms of money or another product.”</p>

			<p>“An organization or economic system where goods and services are exchanged for one another or for money. Every business requires some form of investment and enough customers to whom its output can be sold on a consistent basis in order to make a profit.”</p>

			<p>When we have understood the sufficient knowledge of Business term the second comes what we want to do….? Like what kind of business we want to do? What will be our product? How and from where we get sufficient funds for starting up? There are so many questions may arise in our mind.</p>
			
			<p>Let discuss it,</p>
			
			<p class="black">Start a business for Indian Owners.</p>
			
			<p>There is five option for us out of which we need to choose one It is the category of our Business.</p>

Where we may need a huge capital or investment. One more thing is as compare to Proprietorship, Under Proprietorship we are the only one who has the complete control over our business but in case of Partnership we want or not we must take our Partner’s consent but on the other hand we are not the only person who has to bear all profit and loss of the Business.
